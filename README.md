Group name: Best Burgh

We determined that the best neigborhood in pittsburgh would be the neighberhood that was the safest to live in. We looked at three data sets that showed us fire incidents, arrest reports, and crime activity. We decided which ever neibherhood had the least amount of incidents between the three data sets that would be the safest neighberhood to live in.

Based on all of the data sets we determined that Mount Oliver would be the safest neighberhood to live in because it has the least amount of incidents between the three data sets.
